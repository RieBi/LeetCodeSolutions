# RieBi's LeetCode Solutions
Here you can find my solutions of LeetCode problems in C# language.

The repository is structured in the following way:
- :briefcase: In repository folder, there is a folder for each thousand of problems
- :file_folder: In each folder, there is a file which contains a class with a hundred of problems
- :paperclip: Each solution to a problem is in a method or a class supplied with ProblemSolutionAttribute attribute
- :sunglasses: Running the solution would log the numbers of completed problems to the console, and the total number of them, and would as well update this file
